# Kotlin Workshop #
## Activity 3 (Nullability and Smart Casts) ##

#### Description ####
For this activity, you will deal with both nullable types as well as Any types with smart casting. Kotlin include a large set of different operators to deal with nullable data types that should help keep those pesky NPEs out of your code.

You'll need to write two functions. The first of which will take two nullable `Int`s and add them while treating a null value as 0. The second function will take one regular `Int` and another parameter as `Any?` and add them treating the `Any?` as 0 if it's not an `Int` or it's null.

#### Notes ####
You will need the Kotlin reference for [null safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html) which is quite concise.
