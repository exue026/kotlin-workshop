# Kotlin Workshop #
## Activity 1 (Parameters) ##

#### Description ####
For this activity, you will have to create a function that takes advantage of both named and default parameters.

#### Input ####
Your function should take a required email address, a first name and last name, defaulting to "John" and "Doe" respectively and an age defaulting to 18.

#### Output ####
Your function should return a string with all this information included in the following format:
"email belongs to firstName lastName who is age year/years old."
with the plural on year depending on the age.

#### Notes ####
Kotlin documentation around the features required can be found [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html).

You'll have to uncomment the commented code in `Main.kt` to run your methods after you've define and implemented them.
